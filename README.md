# ASP.NET MVC Playground Sandbox

This repository serves as a personal sandbox to explore, learn, and experiment with the ASP.NET MVC Framework. It contains various projects structured to help deepen familiarity with different aspects of ASP.NET MVC, such as routing, controllers, views, models, and other essential concepts.

## Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder, with each containing an individual solution (.sln) file. The folder arrangement allows each project to be self-contained and independently executable, which makes it easier to focus on one topic at a time.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To work with this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Visual Studio 2019 or later (any edition supporting ASP.NET MVC development)
- .NET Framework (target framework may vary between projects)
- SQL Server (for projects requiring database interaction)
- SQL Server Management Studio (for database management) [Optional]

### Cloning the Repository
This repository is available on both [Azure DevOps](https://abmprottoy.visualstudio.com/_git/ASP.NET) and [GitHub](https://github.com/abmprottoy/aspnet-playground). GitHub repo is the mirror of Azure DevOps repo. Updates and changes will be synced periodically to GitHub. To clone the repository locally, run:  

Azure DevOps Repo:  
```git clone https://abmprottoy.visualstudio.com/ASP.NET/_git/ASP.NET```  

or, GitHub Repo:  
```git clone https://github.com/abmprottoy/aspnet-playground.git```

### Running a Project
Each project is independent and includes its own solution (.sln) file for convenience. To run a project:

- Open the desired project folder.
- Open the .sln file in Visual Studio.
- Set the startup project if necessary (usually automatically set).
- Restore/Update NuGet packages if prompted.
- Build and run the solution.

Each project will open in its own Visual Studio instance, allowing you to work with multiple projects side-by-side if desired.

### Repository Contents
The structure is designed to support a wide range of topics within ASP.NET MVC. Typical project themes might include:

- Basic Routing: Understanding how routing works in MVC applications.
- Controller and Action Basics: Experimenting with controllers, actions, and their lifecycle.
- Models and Data Binding: Working with data models, model binding, and validation.
- Views and Razor Syntax: Practicing with views and Razor syntax to generate dynamic HTML.
- Authentication and Authorization: Implementing forms-based authentication and role-based authorization.
- REST API Development: Building basic APIs within the MVC framework.
- Error Handling and Logging: Exploring error handling techniques and logging mechanisms.
- Dependency Injection: Implementing dependency injection in MVC applications.
